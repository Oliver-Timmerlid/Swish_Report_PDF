2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Swish_Report_PDF
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

2. Drag and drop your CSV file into the application window.

3. Click the button to select where to save the converted PDF file.

4. The application will convert the CSV file to PDF and save it to the specified location.
